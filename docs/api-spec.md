# Native ETH protocol API

The browser SDK sends prompt-free proof authorizations to `zkapi-serverd`.
Inference runs directly against the issued provider key.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/health` | Process and deployment summary |
| GET | `/v1/attestation` | Public signing keys and protocol pins |
| GET | `/v2/auth` | Validate the configured Sepolia shared password without side effects |
| GET | `/v2/billing/quote` | Pinned finalized native ETH billing quote |
| POST | `/v2/openrouter/leases` | Verify proof and reserve a bounded runtime key |
| GET | `/v2/openrouter/leases/{client_request_id}` | Non-secret lease status |
| POST | `/v2/openrouter/leases/{client_request_id}` | Retire and settle the exact lease |
| POST | `/v2/openrouter/leases/{client_request_id}/expire` | Authoritative recovery of an expired or superseded unaccepted request |
| POST | `/v2/withdraw/clearance` | Mutual-close Schnorr clearance |
| GET | `/v2/requests/{client_request_id}` | Recover signed settlement |
| GET | `/v2/nullifiers/{nullifier}` | Recover by nullifier |

When public `/health` reports `testnet_password_required: true`, all `/v2/*`
routes require `X-ZKAPI-Testnet-Password`. Missing or incorrect passwords return
HTTP 401 with `error_code: "testnet_password_required"` before request parsing.
See [Sepolia shared password](testnet-auth.md) for the complete access,
transport and credential-lifecycle contract. Mainnet is unaffected.

A lease uses `ApiRequestV2`: client request ID, canonical prompt-free payload,
payload hash, public inputs and `{backend: "groth16_bn254", proof: "base64..."}`.
The authorization payload includes mode/version and its frozen `billing_quote`.
The server recomputes payload/request binding, validates the native quote and
verifies the proof. Proof bytes contain eight canonical 32-byte coordinates
(256 bytes total). Public inputs, proof coordinates and circuit ID are unchanged.

The runtime key is returned once. Retry/recovery must preserve the exact saved
request and journal, including quote and proof. A native gwei solvency bound is
converted to the provider's USD budget using the frozen quote. Settlement uses
actual provider usage converted back to gwei, then verifies/installs a signed
next balance. An unavailable receipt must not be treated as zero usage.

OA-org issuance includes verifier-backed station/org evidence checked by the
browser's independently pinned verifier. Directly managed keys use durable
disable, grace, usage capture and confirmed deletion before settlement. The
provider's aggregate usage delay remains an operator assumption for direct mode.

The indexer provides `/v1/tree/root`, `/v1/tree/snapshot`,
`/v1/tree/notes/{note_id}/path`, `/v1/tree/notes/{note_id}/zero-path`, and
`/v1/tree/next-note-id`; see its route source for the
full endpoint set. On-chain mutual close, escape and expiry recovery use the
native vault ABI through the browser SDK.
